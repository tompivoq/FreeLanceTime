# FreeLanceTime
Lightweight time-management for poor Lance, who needs to be free.
Lance is a freelancer, and works on several projects. He needs to know how much time he spends on each project, how much time is left on each project, and what work he has done when registering time on a project.

### Todo:
* Tests
* Ajax
* TimeEntry
